INPUT & OUTPUT :

Java's I/O package includes a variety of Streams that enable users to carry out all input-output activities. 
To completely execute I/O operations, these streams support all object types, data types, character types, files, etc.

The standard input stream, known as system.in, is used to read characters from the keyboard and other standard input devices.
System.out is the standard output stream used to display a program's output on an output device, such as a computer screen.
The many print functions that we employ to output statements are listed below:

Java's print() function is used to show text on the console. This method receives this text as a parameter in the form of a String. With this technique, the text is printed on the console and the cursor is left where it is at the console. 


Stream class	                 Description
BufferedInputStream	           It is used for Buffered Input Stream.
DataInputStream	               It contains method for reading java standard datatypes.
FileInputStream	               This is used to reads from a file
InputStream	                   This is an abstract class that describes stream input.
PrintStream	                   This contains the most used print() and println() method
BufferedOutputStream	         This is used for Buffered Output Stream.
DataOutputStream	             This contains method for writing java standard data types.
FileOutputStream	             This is used to write to a file.
OutputStream	                 This is an abstract class that describe stream output.

DATA TYPES:
The different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable are specified by the data types. Java supports two different kinds of data types:

boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float, and double are examples of primitive data types.
Data types that aren't primitive: Arrays, Classes, and Interfaces are examples of non-primitive data types.

There are 8 types of primitive data types:

boolean data type
byte data type
char data type
short data type
int data type
long data type
float data type
double data type


OPERATORS:

   Operator	          Name	                Description                             	Example
      +	            Addition	        Adds together two values        	               x + y
      -	          Subtraction	        Subtracts one value from another    	           x - y
      *       	Multiplication      	Multiplies two values                            x * y
      /	            Division	        Divides one value by another                   	 x / y
      %	            Modulus         	Returns the division remainder	                 x % y
     ++	           Increment	        Increases the value of a variable by 1	         ++x
     --	           Decrement        	Decreases the value of a variable by 1	         --x
